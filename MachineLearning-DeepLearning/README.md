# High Frequency Data Analysis Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project is part of the final assignment for the Machine Learning course (MGTF 424), where the goal is to predict the return on assets (ROA) using high-frequency trading data. The dataset includes various indicators generated by a black-box algorithm and anonymized to ensure data privacy. This project involves a two-step process:
- **Classification:** Predicting the Region of Interest (ROI) using LSTM, RandomForestClassifier, and GradientBoostingClassifier. ROA depends on the value and distribution of features in the ROI, so only the value of features in the ROI timestamp are used to predict the ROA.
- **Regression:** Predicting the Return on Asset (ROA) using CNN, RandomForestRegressor, and GradientBoostingRegressor.

## Objectives
- **Classification:** Predicting the Region of Interest (ROI) using various models.
- **Regression:** Predicting the Return on Asset (ROA) using various models.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of high-frequency intra-day trading data, tracked over multiple assets. Due to privacy constraints, the actual data cannot be shared. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the data:
- **Static Features:** Return on Asset (target variable), Company Age, Company Size, Revenue
- **Time-Series Features:** 12 indicators
- **Binary Variable:** Region of Interest (ROI)

## Installation Instructions
To run the notebook, you need Python and the following libraries:
- pandas, numpy, tabulate, datetime, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib, seaborn

## Methodology

### Step 1: Classification
**Models Used:**
- LSTM
- RandomForestClassifier
- GradientBoostingClassifier

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC Curve

Note: GridSearchCV was used for tuning the hyperparameters of RandomForestClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier. Some features with low importance ('indicator_1b', 'indicator_1c', 'indicator_2b', 'indicator_2c') were removed to improve the model performance.

### Step 2: Regression
**Models Used:**
- RandomForestRegressor
- GradientBoostingRegressor
- CNN

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Note: GridSearchCV was used for tuning the hyperparameters of RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor.

## Key Findings

### Classification

| Model                        | Precision | Recall  | F1 Score | ROC-AUC |
|------------------------------|-----------|---------|----------|---------|
| **LSTM**                     | 0.9236    | 0.8996  | 0.9114   | 0.9461  |
| **Random Forest Classifier** | 0.8614    | 0.7547  | 0.8045   | 0.9793  |
| **Gradient Boosting Classifier** | 0.8454  | 0.7809  | 0.8119   | 0.9820  |

### Regression

| Model                         | Training MAE | Validation MAE |
|-------------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Random Forest Regressor**   | 5.5169       | 4.4219         |
| **Gradient Boosting Regressor** | 5.3024     | 4.6496         |
| **CNN**                       | 6.5682       | 6.6501         |

## Selected Models
- **For classification**, LSTM was chosen due to its superior F1 score.
- **For regression**, Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) was selected for its lower MAE compared to the other models.

## Results
The project evaluates the performance of multiple models for both classification and regression tasks. Key plots and visualizations include:
- Precision-Recall curves
- ROC curves
- Confusion matrices
- Feature importance charts
- Error distribution plots

## Summary and Conclusion
Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models in predicting asset returns using high-frequency trading data. Despite computational constraints, the chosen models (LSTM for classification and GBR for regression) provided satisfactory performance. The results highlight the importance of feature selection and model choice in financial prediction tasks.

Note: Due to the lack of target variables for the test set, the models were evaluated on validation and training sets.
