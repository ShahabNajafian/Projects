# High Frequency Data Analysis Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project is part of the final assignment for the MGTF 424 course, where the goal is to predict the return on assets (ROA) using high-frequency trading data. The dataset includes various indicators generated by a black-box algorithm and anonymized to ensure data privacy. This project involves a two-step process:

1. **Classification**: Predicting the Region of Interest (ROI) using LSTM, RandomForestClassifier, and GradientBoostingClassifier.
2. **Regression**: Predicting the Return on Asset (ROA) using CNN, RandomForestRegressor, and GradientBoostingRegressor.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Classification
- **Models Used**:
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - RandomForestClassifier
  - GradientBoostingClassifier
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve

### Step 2: Regression
- **Models Used**:
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - RandomForestRegressor
  - GradientBoostingRegressor
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Feature Importance

## Data Description

The dataset consists of high-frequency intra-day trading data, tracked over multiple assets. The features include:
- **Static Features**:
  - Return on Asset (target variable)
  - Company Age
  - Company Size
  - Revenue
- **Time-Series Features**:
  - 12 indicators
- **Binary Variable**:
  - Region of Interest (ROI)

The test data includes new assets without the ROI label, requiring robust predictive models to infer the ROA.

## Results

The project evaluates the performance of multiple models for both classification and regression tasks. Key plots and visualizations include:
- Precision-Recall curves
- ROC curves
- Confusion matrices
- Feature importance charts
- Error distribution plots

By comparing these models, the project identifies the best-performing model for each task and provides insights into the key factors influencing asset returns.
